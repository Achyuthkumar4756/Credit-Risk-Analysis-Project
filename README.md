Sure! Here's a detailed `README.md` for a Credit Risk Analysis project:

# Credit Risk Analysis

A comprehensive credit risk analysis tool to evaluate the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. This project leverages machine learning models to predict the likelihood of default on loans.

## Overview

Credit risk analysis is crucial for financial institutions to manage and mitigate the risk associated with lending. This project aims to provide a robust and scalable solution for predicting credit risk using various machine learning techniques.



## Data

This project requires a dataset containing historical loan data. The dataset should include features such as:

- Loan Amount
- Term
- Interest Rate
- Annual Income
- Employment Length
- Credit History
- Purpose of Loan
- Debt-to-Income Ratio
- Delinquencies

## Models

The following machine learning models are implemented in this project:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC AUC
